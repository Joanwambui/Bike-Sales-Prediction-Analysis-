# Data Exploration
After data-cleaning my next task was data exploration to familiarize myself better with the data.The dataset had some interesting factors that I thought would provide key insights about our customers.Some of these factors included:Age, Bike related purchases over the last 3 years, Wealth segmentation and Number of Cars owned.I created pivot tables and visualizations to help others understand how these factors would be important in our analysis for accurate insights as illustrated below:

# RFM Analysis
Finally after data exploration I went ahead to perform RFM analysis,a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns.This seemed best suited for my analysis in Excel.The formula used was as follows:
